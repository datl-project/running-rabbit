Mobile game in portrait modeÂ¶
Set the base window width to 720 and window height to 1280.

Alternatively, if you're targeting high-end devices primarily, set the base window width to 1080 and window height to 1920. This allows you to provide higher resolution 2D assets, resulting in crisper visuals at the cost of higher memory usage and file sizes. Many devices have even higher resolution displays (1440p), but the difference with 1080p is barely visible given the small size of smartphone displays. Note that this will make non-mipmapped textures grainy on low resolution devices, so make sure to follow the instructions described in Reducing aliasing on downsampling.

Set Display > Window > Handheld > Orientation to portrait.

Set the stretch mode to canvas_items.

Set the stretch aspect to expand. This allows for supporting multiple aspect ratios and makes better use of tall smartphone displays (such as 18:9 or 19:9 aspect ratios).

Configure Control nodes' anchors to snap to the correct corners using the Layout menu.




To better support tablets and foldable phones (which frequently feature displays with aspect ratios close to 4:3), consider using a base resolution that has a 3:4 aspect ratio while following the rest of the instructions here. For instance, you can set the base window width to 960 and the base window height to 1280.
